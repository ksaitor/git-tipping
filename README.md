# Tipping

Tip github contributors without leaving github ui. Gitcoin used to have this feature, but not any more! ðŸ¥² This project aims to bring back tipping to Github (and eventually other platforms) without leaving the website. 

# Components
- Browser extensions - to augment Github UI and let tipping happen without leaving the site.
- Wallet <> Github Account registry - so that the app knows where to route your tips
- Smart Contracts (eventually) - potentially letting users maintain a balance for frictionless UX.
